In Salesforce, a trigger is a piece of Apex code that executes
 before or after the following types of operations:

Insert
Update
Delete
Undelete
Triggers are associated with one or more 
objects and can be used to perform custom logic on 
records before or after they are saved to the database.
 Triggers can be used to enforce business rules, validate data, 
 or update related records based on changes made to a record. 
 For example, a trigger can be used to automatically update a 
 related field in another object when a record is created or updated 
 in the current object. Triggers are a powerful tool in Salesforce development and 
can be used to automate tasks and improve the user experience.
